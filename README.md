A powerful, real-time network monitoring application with advanced security assessment capabilities, multi-language support, and modern GUI design.
üöÄ Features
Core Monitoring

Real-time Network Monitoring: Monitor all active network connections with live updates
Process Identification: Track which processes are making network connections
Connection Details: View local/remote addresses, ports, and connection status
Security Assessment: Advanced security scoring system for risk evaluation

Security Features

Digital Signature Verification: Check if executables are digitally signed (Windows)

Dark/Light Themes: Toggle between terminal-style dark mode and clean light mode
Advanced Filtering: Regex-based search with security level filtering
Sortable Columns: Click any column header to sort data
Context Menus: Right-click for quick actions (copy, terminate, open location)

Data Management

CSV Export: Export filtered data to CSV files with timestamps
Real-time Updates: Configurable refresh intervals (200ms - 60s)

Performance Statistics: Monitor application performance and cache efficiency

üìã Requirements
System Requirements

jsonschema>=4.0.0
üõ†Ô∏è Installation
Method 1: Clone and Install
bash# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/haiderkareem/iseeyou-network-monitor.git
cd iseeyou-network-monitor

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate virtual environment
# Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# Linux/macOS:
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
Method 2: Direct Installation
bash# Install dependencies directly
pip install psutil PySide6 jsonschema

# Download and run
python main.py
üöÄ Usage
Basic Usage
bash# Run the application
python main.py

# Run with administrator privileges (recommended for Windows)
# Right-click Command Prompt -> "Run as administrator"
python main.py
Command Line Options
bash# Run with custom config file
python main.py --config custom_settings.json

# Run in debug mode
python main.py --debug

# Show version information
python main.py --version
üéõÔ∏è Configuration
Settings File
The application creates a settings.json file with the following options:
json{
  "interval_ms": 1000,
  "only_established": true,
  "autostart": true,
  "lang": "en",
  "theme": "dark"
}
Configuration Options

üîí Security Features
Security Scoring Algorithm
The application uses a sophisticated scoring system:

Digital Signatures: +25 for valid, -15 for unsigned
System Paths: +15 for trusted locations
Temporary Directories: -20 for temp locations
Network Analysis: Bonus for private IPs, penalty for suspicious destinations
Port Assessment: +15 for HTTPS, penalties for dangerous ports
Process Privileges: -8 for admin processes

Risk Levels

üü¢ Safe (75-100): Trusted processes with valid signatures
üü° Medium (45-74): Standard processes with mixed indicators
üî¥ Risk (0-44): Suspicious processes requiring attention

üåç Language Support
Supported Languages

English - Full support with left-to-right layout
ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿäÿ© (Arabic) - Complete RTL support with Arabic translations
–†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π (Russian) - Full Cyrillic support

Adding New Languages
To add a new language:

Add language dictionary to I18N in main.py:

python'fr': {
    'app_title': "I See You ‚Äî Moniteur R√©seau Avanc√©",
    'start': "D√©marrer",
    # ... add all keys
}

Update language selector in change_language() method
Test RTL support if needed

üé® Themes
Dark Theme (Default)

Terminal-style green-on-black interface
Matrix-inspired color scheme
Optimized for extended monitoring sessions

Light Theme

Clean, modern interface
High contrast for daylight use
Color-coded security levels

üìä Performance
Optimization Features

Batch Processing: Connections processed in configurable batches
Smart Caching: LRU cache with TTL for signature verification
Memory Management: Automatic cleanup and resource management
Threading: Non-blocking UI with background monitoring

Performance Statistics
The application tracks:

Connections processed per second
Cache hit rates
Memory usage
Error rates

üîß Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Permission Errors
bash# Windows: Run as Administrator
# Linux/macOS: Run with sudo
sudo python main.py
Missing Dependencies
bash# Install missing packages
pip install psutil PySide6 jsonschema
Performance Issues

Increase update interval in settings
Enable "Show only established connections"
Close other resource-intensive applications

Debug Mode
bash# Enable detailed logging
python main.py --debug

# Check log files
cat logs/network_monitor.log
Log Files
Logs are stored in logs/network_monitor.log with rotation:

Maximum file size: 10MB
Backup files: 5
Includes timestamps, function names, and line numbers
